And I did. I spent evenings<br \/>\n on concrete floors in squalid dorm rooms where teenage girls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsweet and<br \/>\ngiggly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dspent their scarce nonworking hours. Eight or even 10 to a room.<br \/>\nThey told me stories about not being able to leave their machines to<br \/>\npee. About bosses who hit. About not having enough money to buy dried<br \/>\nfish to go with their rice.<\/p>\n<p>They knew they were being badly exploited\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat the garments<br \/>\nthey were making were being sold for more than they would make in a<br \/>\nmonth. One 17-year-old said to me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We make computers, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know<br \/>\n how to use them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>So one thing I found slightly jarring was that some of these<br \/>\n same workers wore clothing festooned with knockoff trademarks of the<br \/>\nvery multinationals that were responsible for these conditions: Disney<br \/>\ncharacters or Nike check marks. At one point, I asked a local labor<br \/>\norganizer about this. Wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it strange\u00e2\u20ac\u201da contradiction?<\/p>\n<p>It took a very long time for him to understand the question.<br \/>\n When he finally did, he looked at me like I was nuts. You see, for him<br \/>\nand his colleagues, individual consumption wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t considered to be in<br \/>\nthe realm of politics at all. Power rested not in what you did as one<br \/>\nperson, but what you did as many people, as one part of a large,<br \/>\norganized, and focused movement. For him, this meant organizing workers<br \/>\nto go on strike for better conditions, and eventually it meant winning<br \/>\nthe right to unionize. What you ate for lunch or happened to be wearing<br \/>\nwas of absolutely no concern whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p><b>This was striking to me, because it was the mirror opposite<br \/>\nof my culture back home in Canada. Where I came from, you expressed your<br \/>\n political beliefs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfirstly and very often lastly\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthrough personal<br \/>\nlifestyle choices. By loudly proclaiming your vegetarianism. By shopping<br \/>\n fair trade and local and boycotting big, evil brands.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>These very different understandings of social change came up<br \/>\n again and again a couple of years later, once my book came out. I would<br \/>\n give talks about the need for international protections for the right<br \/>\nto unionize. About the need to change our global trading system so it<br \/>\ndidn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encourage a race to the bottom. And yet at the end of those<br \/>\ntalks, the first question from the audience was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What kind of sneakers<br \/>\nare OK to buy?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What brands are ethical?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where do you buy your<br \/>\nclothes?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What can I do, as an individual, to change the world?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Fifteen years after I published No Logo, I still<br \/>\nfind myself facing very similar questions. These days, I give talks<br \/>\nabout how the same economic model that superpowered multinationals to<br \/>\nseek out cheap labor in Indonesia and China also supercharged global<br \/>\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. And, invariably, the hand goes up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me<br \/>\nwhat I can do as an individual.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Or maybe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a business owner.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p><b>The hard truth is that the answer to the question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What can<br \/>\nI, as an individual, do to stop climate change?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is: nothing. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t<br \/>\ndo anything. In fact, the very idea that we\u00e2\u20ac\u201das atomized individuals,<br \/>\neven lots of atomized individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcould play a significant part in<br \/>\nstabilizing the planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climate system, or changing the global economy,<br \/>\n is objectively nuts. We can only meet this tremendous challenge<br \/>\ntogether. As part of a massive and organized global movement.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The irony is that people with relatively little power tend<br \/>\nto understand this far better than those with a great deal more power.<br \/>\nThe workers I met in Indonesia and the Philippines knew all too well<br \/>\nthat governments and corporations did not value their voice or even<br \/>\ntheir lives as individuals. And because of this, they were driven to act<br \/>\n not only together, but to act on a rather large political canvas. To<br \/>\ntry to change the policies in factories that employ thousands of<br \/>\nworkers, or in export zones that employ tens of thousands. Or the labor<br \/>\nlaws in an entire country of millions. Their sense of individual<br \/>\npowerlessness pushed them to be politically ambitious, to demand<br \/>\nstructural changes.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, here in wealthy countries, we are told how<br \/>\npowerful we are as individuals all the time. As consumers. Even<br \/>\nindividual activists. And the result is that, despite our power and<br \/>\nprivilege, we often end up acting on canvases that are unnecessarily<br \/>\nsmall\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe canvas of our own lifestyle, or maybe our neighborhood or<br \/>\ntown. Meanwhile, we abandon the structural changes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe policy and legal<br \/>\nwork\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto others.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/210225\/climate-change-crisis-we-can-only-solve-together#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Naomi Klein<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>popthirdworld: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I was 26, I went to Indonesia and the Philippines to do research for my first book, No Logo.
