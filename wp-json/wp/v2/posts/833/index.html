Scientifically smug lay people. They always scoff at the ignorance of the people in the past, how cultures clung to the ideas of magic and religion to explain the forces around them, of course this was handed down by the superiors of the society who knew in actuality how the science worked. The irony is that is THE EXACT SAME WAY OUR CULTURE WORKS. Sure they changed the word from &ldquo;magic&rdquo; to &ldquo;science&rdquo;, and I think we all agree there is someone in some ivory tower (or more correctly many people in many towers) who could painstakingly explain all the scientific phenomenon we understand. But, as far as the layperson is concerned &#8211; they dont know &#8211; they have no fucking idea, but they will be the first to lecture about a system and measure they have a 5th grade science project understanding about.<\/p>\n<p>You know Im a scientist and I&rsquo;m all about empiricism, but BECAUSE im a scientist and BECAUSE im an intellectual i realize the assumptions empiricism is based upon and its limitations. The fact that its a pretty damn good system that makes all of the things we enjoy a possibility is not to be confused with it being a perfect system capable of doing anything.<\/p>\n<p>In fact with a simple calculator I can show how math does not accurately quantify reality, I can pick up a philosophy book and show you how logically and empirically, empiricism folds in on itself. I could do a dozen different things and I promise you; NONE would impress you or change your mind because &ldquo;science&rdquo; is so ingrained in our culture, its the magic and the religion of our times.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know what really irritates me as a scientist?
