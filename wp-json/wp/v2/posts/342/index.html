I started playing piano when I was four and I still absolutely SUCK at sheet music. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just never clicked for me. I can identify notes, given enough time, but it takes me forever to learn a new piece, I often have to literally mark what a note is, and sight-reading is incredibly far beyond me. If I had access to this, maybe I would still be playing piano instead of just letting it gather dust in the spare room. Maybe I would still be improving my skills. Heck, maybe I could use it as a tool to IMPROVE MY SHEET MUSIC READING.<\/p>\n<p>Think of how accessible this makes piano music to the sight-impaired. How much easier it is to see those colored bars and lit keys than the little dots on little lines on a page.<\/p>\n<p>Stairs didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out of style because we invented escalators. Books didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out of style because Kindles are a thing. Sheet music isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to just up and vanish because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new alternative on the block. You can keep playing from sheet music if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your thing, and people will keep learning from it.<\/p>\n<p>But I can see this being fantastic for people who sheet music just really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t their thing, because of accessibility or other reasons.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>sapphirefiber: ohthewhomanity: sizvideos: Video But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6what about learning to read sheet music?
