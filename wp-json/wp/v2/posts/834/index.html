It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question that applies not only to cars, but to several other traditional categories of big spending\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmost notably, housing. And its answer has large implications for the future shape of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand for the speed of recovery.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2012\/09\/the-cheapest-generation\/309060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Read more.<\/strong><\/a><em> [Image: Kagan McLeod]<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to say that a decent number of Tumblr users are a part of the Millennial generation. So, tell us: Do you own a car or house? If not, why?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>IT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO DISPOSABLE INCOME YOU THUNDERING IDIOTS. Fucking\u00c2\u00a0<em>preference\u00c2\u00a0<\/em>has nothing to do with it. 50% of college graduates have no job! They all have the most student loan debt <em>ever<\/em>! What are you asking this question for?!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Also: housing is a good bit more expensive now.<\/p>\n<p>My parents got a 15-year mortgage on a new house in the mid-70s. The house was $32,000. Average home price in that area now? $190,000.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So, home prices went up. Food prices went up. Health care prices went WAY UP. Rent prices went up. Higher education went up so damn high that some of us forgo that all together. Energy prices went up. Car prices went up.<\/p>\n<p>Prices of <em>prices<\/em> went up.<\/p>\n<p>We also pay cell phone bills, internet bills, data plans, text plans, online subscriptions, cable\/satellite\u00c2\u00a0tv, netflix, DVR subscriptions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d <strong>bills that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even exist 30-40 years ago<\/strong>. We also use computers and smartphones and microwaves and other consumer electronics that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist 20-50 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>We need medications and doctors and contact lenses and tampons and maxi pads and other things that cost money just to be alive and keep us healthy.<\/p>\n<p>Most of us can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get married and have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Traditional\u00e2\u20ac\u009d big wedding<\/li>\n<li>Buy a house<\/li>\n<li>Buy a new car<\/li>\n<li>PLAN to have children<\/li>\n<li>Take two, consecutive weeks of vacation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Jobs that paid 50k in the late 1990s now pay between 30-35. Interest rates that favor consumers have gone down.<\/p>\n<p>So I say, no. We are not choosing not to buy homes. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not choosing to take the bus in cities where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no good public transit. WE ARE NOT CHOOSING TO LIVE WHAT SOCIETY DEEMS AS AN UNDESIRABLE LIFESTYLE.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get me started on the fact that these two people in the picture are young white hipsters. <strong>Young black and brown folks have been forgoing homeownership and buying new cars for decades, this shit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t new, pal. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just acting like this shit is new because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hitting white folks.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>anyway, my point is:<strong> We are fucking broke.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>read the commentary above ^^<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>dem-queer-animals: awesome-everyday: shorterexcerpts: thecallus: theatlantic: The Cheapest Generation: Why Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Millennials Buying Cars or Houses?
