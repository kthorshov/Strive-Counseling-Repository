Nobody is ever going to hear them playing in some bar with a couple hits on their myspace page. These companies connect point A to point B, they spend a lot of money doing it and filter out a lot of crap that we are better off avoiding. Are the perfect? No. Do they take an unfair amount of profits? Are they corrupt? Yes &#8211; BUT thats a tired old tale. Republicans are always crying out that food stamps, or wic, or any other social service is corrupt, and they are right, a degree of corruption takes place. However the solution isnt to end the phenomenon in question (as I think in both cases we are better off with the corrupt entities than without them at all) it is to minimize the corruption.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe liberal is a bad word choice &#8211; Its just short sightedly consumer-centric. Its slightly ironic. The huge businesses that have\u00c2\u00a0cemented\u00c2\u00a0the ideology that &ldquo;the customer is always right&rdquo; &ldquo;we believe the customers should get less for more&rdquo; &ldquo;we live and die for the cusssstomer&rdquo; are now finding themselves in the position they have put the lowliest of their workers in, now they get to deal with an entitled customer, with a scewed sense of reality, who thinks products and services rain from the sky for free &#8211; just for them &#8211; because they are the CUSTOMER.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but every once in a while i see something so short sightedly liberal that it awakens the capitalist republican of my roots thats sleeps deep inside me.
