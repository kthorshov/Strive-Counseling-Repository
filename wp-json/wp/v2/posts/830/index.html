While the whole &ldquo;this generation will be the end of us&rdquo; is an age old complaint, its been hitting the news more than ever. I dont know how today&rsquo;s current economic crisis is to blame on people who are barely getting out of college, but you certainly hear it a lot.<\/p>\n<p>I agree with everything the OP said, my generation doesn&rsquo;t have it easy. Jobs are slim and competition is fierce. We have more student debt than any other time in our nation&rsquo;s history at one of the highest interest rates. We dont live at home because we want to, we live there because we HAVE to. We have put in our efforts, we have paid the price but there is little opportunity due to the situation our CURRENT generation has left us in.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00c2\u00a0narcissist\u00c2\u00a0thing is the worst. You want a PAID internship? Selfish. You want to wait to have children until you are more stable? Selfish. You expect health care? a reasonable cost of living? a payscale that reflects the cost of your education and a desire to be able to have a house, family or any kind of life outside the office? you want work hours and vacation days that reflect that as well? Damn, we are the worst people to have ever lived. In reality we are very normal people with very modest goals. People I know who are artists never expect to be rich &#8211; they are willing to give it up for their passion. Even me as a scientist, I&rsquo;m willing to give up my chance to ever make even six figures to be able to do something that fulfills me. But there is a line, there is a point when enough is enough. I&rsquo;m still a person, I still want to be able to enjoy my life, to have other interests and goals and relationships outside of work. This is not a lot to ask for. It is not selfish.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/68.media.tumblr.com\/bee092b44982d963a55385a47a9c0819\/tumblr_inline_mnht2idb1e1qz4rgp.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TIME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new cover makes me so mad I could write essays about it, but instead I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to keep job hunting since in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world a university degree means nothing and therefore like much of my generation, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m stuck choosing between minimum wage jobs and internships that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to accept in an attempt [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33556501,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/830"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33556501"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=830"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/830\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=830"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=830"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=830"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
