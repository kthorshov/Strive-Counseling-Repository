Housing these people led to dramatic cost savings that more than paid for the cost of putting them in decent housing, including $1.8 million in health care savings from 447 fewer ER visits (78% reduction) and 372 fewer hospital days (79% reduction). Tenants also spent 84 fewer days in jail, with a 72% drop in arrests.<\/p>\n<p>Moore Place cost $6 million in land and construction costs, and tenants are required to contribute 30% of their income (mainly benefits) towards rent. The remainder of the $14,000 per tenant annually is covered by donations and local and federal funding. <strong>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nchousing.org\/annual-conference\/past-conferences\/2013-conference\/2013-workshops\/presentations\/301b\/caroline-chambre.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UNCC study<\/a>, that $14,000 pales in comparison to the costs a chronically homeless person racks up every year to society \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a stunning $39,458 in combined medical, judicial and other costs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, Moore Place is enabling the formerly homeless to find their own sources of income. Without housing, just 50% were able to generate any income. One year after move-in, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up to 82%. And after an average length of 7 years of homelessness, 94% of the original tenants retained their housing after 18 months, with a 99% rent collection rate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The general population is biased:<\/strong> The original proposal for Moore Place was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153controversial, if not ridiculed,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d according to the\u00c2\u00a0<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charlotteobserver.com\/2014\/03\/23\/4787934\/study-concludes-charlotte-homeless.html#.UzL-lPldUiM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charlotte Observer<\/a>.<\/em> Locals mocked the idea that giving the homeless subsidized housing would do any good.
