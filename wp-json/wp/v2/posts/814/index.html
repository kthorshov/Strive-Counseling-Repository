It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just stupid, and makes so many people who potentially agree with the message not want to educate them self or get into it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>For the record, it was made by a white man. But who cares? A white man who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand that this type of thing is a reactionary joke based on their place of privilege in society probably doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a place in feminism\/social justice anyway. Good riddance.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Definitely don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter who made it, their gender or their colour. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re new at this and this is what meets you, your first thought is going to be: why do they hate white men? I get what this message means, but I also get that people who potentially wanna get into it wont get it, or will take it as an insult\/attack and not understand it. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with this kind of stuff cause it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help us get rid of the stereotype of angry women who hate men. And it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make people who should be EDUCATED(btw) want to listen either. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better ways to approach it instead of making white guys feel shit about them self for being born white.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not worried about priortizing concern for the feelings of white guys because white guys have repeated shown no interest in reflecting on how their actions impace the feelings of people who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t white guys. And yes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m saying that as a white guy. You need to realize that people with privilege will take any imposition on their entitlement as a grevious affront. There is no way to play nice that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t insist hurts their feelings. And if you are a white guy who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be petty enough to withhold support for civil rights because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think someone was sufficently deferential in trying to secure those rights? Well, you ARE being targeted. You deserve to feel targeted. You should have your positions shaken up and challenged. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m continually perplexed at how this is positioned as a bad thing. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to change things here. That means upsetting the status quo. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that without making the status quo upset.<\/p>\n<p>You know what? White guys can take having their feelings hurt. What has been done in our name is a lot fucking worse than that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not interested in pursuing the kind of change white guys are comfortable with. We should be made uncomfortable. We should be pushed past our limits. Myself included. Social change that is limited to the imaginations of white dudes isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fucking enough. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fucking anything.<\/p>\n<p>You say this feeds into sterotypes of angry women who hate men, but who do you think created those sterotypes? It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t women. It was men. Mostly white men who wanted to dismiss women and belittle women, so they invented charactitures and straw feminists to bemoan. That sterotype isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something feminism brought upon itself. It was a tool of men who wanted to ignore women. It is a crutch for mysogony. It should not be treated with one ounce of plausibility and it should now disuade one iota of ire. Same for all of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153angry marginalized\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stereotypes that are all really just mocking people for being upset by systems of oppression. They all have reason to be angry, quite simply. White dudes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Shed no tear for us. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Ive never seen someone use so much racial prejudice, sexism,\u00c2\u00a0privilege\u00c2\u00a0and bullying in the defense of feminism. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Ive written about 5 different responses for this and none of them seem be able to unpack all the responses your comment warrants. So Im going to start off by saying this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for everything you just said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you need to check your own privilege. You walk in and instantly violate several feminist principles and make a statement taking feminism down a (stereotypically male) violent path. Feminism isnt about busting in peoples doors and blowing off their kneecaps with a pistol to make your point. Feminism doesn&rsquo;t need to resort to physical or emotional violence to be heard. Its not so weak that it needs to humiliate the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white man\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to get attention or convince others it has value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thats exactly what its fighting against. Furthermore, nobody died and made you king of the white guys. Being part of a group gives you two capacities; you can talk about your own experiences, or you can talk about your own experiences as part of the group. You do not get to generalize your life and personal experiences over that entire group. Tokenism is bad. Second, when you say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not worried about prioritizing feelings of white guys&hellip;because&rsquo; I just want to point out that you aren&rsquo;t saying what you are doing is wrong, in fact you are kind of admitting it is wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you just don&rsquo;t care. Telling someone they have rights connected to their personhood but you just dont care? thats kind of a big deal with feminism.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>red3blog: catcube: facebooksexism: catcube: Just\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is like the best way ever to make potential people who want to take a part in this movement NOT JOIN because they think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re targeting them, making them feel shit cause they are born white and male.
