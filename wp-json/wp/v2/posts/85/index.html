I almost forgot what it was like to be able to wear a sweater or be physically close to a human being for more than one minute without everyone stewing to death in each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweat.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever someone here in Iowa catches that we moved from Florida, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always remarks about how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lucky\u00e2\u20ac\u009d we were to be there, how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d we were to leave it, or how terrible it must be to experience a winter. These are people who have likely never been to Florida, and probably think Florida looks like this:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/68.media.tumblr.com\/b4c19ae9326e80517cfda71f584b033b\/tumblr_inline_nzy113CcA81qbgh4j_540.jpg\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>When most of Florida actually looks like either this:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/68.media.tumblr.com\/25b5e64d6ae10d607294ca5aeb06866b\/tumblr_inline_nzy11nVHqW1qbgh4j_540.jpg\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Or this:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/68.media.tumblr.com\/f60041ec1ce3ca45e020d5d87eee1893\/tumblr_inline_nzy124iG4E1qbgh4j_540.jpg\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Florida was built mostly on what used to be swampland, which was drained and filled in with imported soil and gravel until houses could be built on it. This means that most of where you go in Florida, the ground itself is basically fake, and it looks the part. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flat as a pancake, there are perfect, straight drainage ditches instead of rivers or streams and the hills are blocky, artificial things wealthy people have on their properties to keep their shit above flood level.<\/p>\n<p><b>It is not pretty enough to compensate for its climate.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Now, you probably think you know what being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too hot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is like. Maybe you live in Australia or Nevada or something and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to fry eggs on the sidewalk. Yeah, nasty. Like living in an oven, right?<\/p>\n<p>Your <i>NICE, DRY<\/i> fucking oven.<\/p>\n<p>Florida spends most of the year in the high 80\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2s at a minimum, the sky is usually cloudless, buildings are built low to the ground and the trees are either palms or scrappy little things offering next to zero shade. The sun is perpetually baking every single surface, to the point that a freshly paved road goes from black to chalky white within weeks.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, EVERYTHING outdoors is steadily bleached chalky white. <b>You better love pastels<\/b> because no matter what you paint your house or decorate your lawn with, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to <b>become<\/b> pastel. Pastel with streaks of piss yellow.<\/p>\n<p>\u00c2\u00a0 NORMALLY, an environment like this is also associated with dryness, but Florida is not normal.<\/p>\n<p>In Florida, there is almost no reprieve from the humidity. Not in its coolest \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winters,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and not indoors with any level of climate control. You can never get rid of mold in your house. You can never stop feeling greasy. Often it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so moist outside that breathing is physically difficult. Again, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably experienced this, but there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too many places, at least in America, where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck with it some 330 days of the year.<\/p>\n<p>And moisture, as you may know, traps additional heat, so when they say Florida is 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the <b>ambient <\/b>temperature, in the open air. You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t air. You are a solid mass that produces body heat and moisture of its own, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re legally required to wear some amount of clothing when you step outside. The air may be 90 degrees, but you are going to feel about 120 degrees, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably going to just steadily get worse until your next opportunity to shower or stand directly in front of an air conditioner for a while.<\/p>\n<p>So Florida combines the blistering sun of Death Valley with the moisture of the Amazon Basin, without looking as nice as either of those places. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like they had a baby but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re two different species so the baby is some freakish sterile donkey monster. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Florida. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the <b>abominable mule<\/b> of a rainforest and a desert.<\/p>\n<p>And we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even gotten to THE SMELL yet! Do you realize what it smells like when an entire state is <b>both too wet and too hot ALL<\/b> the god damned time? When there is never any cool, dry period long enough to clear the air of the collective funk of every possible surface being slowly, perpetually broiled?<\/p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/68.media.tumblr.com\/9a78da9ad182c5d371e19356df916b3b\/tumblr_inline_nzy13a7CuQ1qbgh4j_540.jpg\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Think of how much plastic and rubber is lying around one city. Have you smelled burning plastic and rubber? Now think about how much garbage is lying around in one city. The garbage in the streets, in the cans outside every business, in the cans on the lawns of several million households, all both too hot and too wet. All the time.<\/p>\n<p>Next, factor in the usual level of air pollution when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a dense population, made denser by the number of people vacationing there and visiting their elderly family memmbers all year round. <b>Good god, the traffic<\/b>. On top of the car exhaust fumes hanging around in the wet air, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got the collective odor of the people themselves, since everyone is constantly pouring sweat and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly afford enough showers to keep up with the stink.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that the fact that, despite the wetness, you are never more than a couple miles from something on fire. Sometimes acres and acres of Florida scrubland are on fire. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear fire trucks multiple times a day no matter where you are, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not here to talk about the noise pollution, which would make this post go on even longer &#8211; as would any talk of its equally godawful political and cultural environment.<\/p>\n<p>You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also never very far from either a beach, brackish river or estuary, of course, and that means you can top off the miasma of bleaching plastic, ash, sweat, body odor, sunscreen, smog and roasting garbage with a whiff of decomposing fish every now and then, like someone quietly hitting a triangle to add one more note to <b>a never-ending song about ass<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>And to cut this nice and short, let me wrap up with two magical words every single Floridian will know intimately well sooner or later in their reeking, roasting stew of a state:<\/p>\n<p><i>FUNGAL.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>INFECTIONS.<\/i><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still living miserable in Florida, or miserable just about anywhere, you can skip this update. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want anybody to feel bad, I just gotta get this out of my own system.<\/p>\n<p>When I wrote this post, we lived in Iowa &#8211; only <b>very marginally<\/b> (almost not at all actually) better than Florida -\u00c2\u00a0 as a temporary stepping stone to where we really wanted to be, the Pacific Northwest, and now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lived in Oregon for about eight months, really due entirely to someone sweet enough to trust us total strangers as last-minute replacement roommates.. We never made more than the equivalent of minimum wage but it honestly came down to either moving out here or possibly actually dying from exacerbated depression. <\/p>\n<p>It may occur to you that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <b><i>almost<\/i> impossible to be any farther from Florida on this continent<\/b>. <\/p>\n<p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a visual for you:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/68.media.tumblr.com\/34218695146d54209669505c230e8e2d\/tumblr_inline_optwbh8G1M1qbgh4j_540.png\" alt=\"image\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>So, here are some things about where we live now:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sun spends more than 50% of days hidden completely behind a sky of grey clouds.

We have had enough sun for ten lifetimes and <b>the sun can die in a ditch forever.<br \/><\/b><\/li>\n<li>It rains several times a week all year round. Good. The rain keeps everything looking and smelling clean and fresh and we have <b>NO allergies<\/b> out here.\u00c2\u00a0Never in my life have I needed so few tissues or pills. <\/li>\n<li>\u00c2\u00a0<b>Everything is green<\/b>.

They would RATHER be somewhere like Florida. Everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different I guess and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cool and okay but if I were a billionaire I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just set up an exchange program so all these fuckin weirdos can go ahead to Florida and those of you stuck in Florida can take over their apartments.
