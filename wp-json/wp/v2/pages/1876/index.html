I attended the University of Texas at Dallas for my Bachelors in Psychology and Texas A&amp;M University at Commerce for my Master\u2019s in Counseling. During my time in university I spent a year working for a mental health crisis line. I spent two years working in a psychological research lab looking at the dynamics of romantic relationships and how conflicts could predict relationship success. Finally, eight years in Community Mental Health doing everything from psychological assessments, medication management, and case management to suicide assessments, to teaching, psychoeducation, coping skills, and career counseling.<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"266\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/melogo.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/melogo.jpg 266w, https:\/\/strive-counseling.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/melogo-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>The problem is the problem, the person is not the problem.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Michael White and David Epston<\/p>\n<p>Experience and Certifications<\/p>\n<p>Trained in ACT by Russ Harris<\/p>\n<p>Certified by the Dulwich Centre for Narrative Therapy<\/p>\n<p>Certified by PESI in LGBTQ Treatment<\/p>\n<p>Certified by PESI for Transgender Affirming Care<\/p>\n<p>Certified by PESI for the Treatment of Anxiety<\/p>\n<p>Certified by PESI for Bringing Trauma-informed Yoga into Mental Health Practices<\/p>\n<p>\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" role=\"button\"><br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSchedule with Me<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: #f4f4f4; font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;\">I\u2019m Kaleb and I really enjoy the work I do. I\u2019m a huge fan of non-fiction, it keeps my facts straight and my wit dry. I almost always have a new therapeutic book on my nightstand. I\u2019m also passionate about social reform and try to be the best advocate I can. It seems like the more I read the longer the list gets. When I\u2019m not on the other side of the couch, I like to think of myself as a gamer who was forced into partial retirement after being wounded in graduate school. But I\u2019m hoping to get the free time back some day to fully reconnect. I\u2019m a prospective cat-dad just waiting for the day that the stork brings me my bundle of joy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: #f4f4f4; font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;\">For those of you who don\u2019t know, the counseling profession is about 80% women. With graduate classes being about 10 people, I was usually the only man in my class. In fact, our graduating class only had one other man besides me. While men often dominate the stage in business, politics and religion it feels strange to be a gender minority in a field. Moreover, it feels weird that men are an underserved and understudied topic in psychotherapy. After working for eight years in community mental health I worked with dozens of male clients who were doing the best they could with what they had but were met with constant opposition. Its not that they weren\u2019t trying but that people in the system weren\u2019t used to understanding their problems from their context and because men are generally considered the majority, the idea that they have special needs and considerations went under the radar.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: #f4f4f4; font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n\t\t\t<!-- Calendly badge widget begin -->\n<link href=\"https:\/\/assets.calendly.com\/assets\/external\/widget.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<!-- Calendly badge widget end --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
